            <p>This is my high school classmate. She is now in college in Seattle, studying economics. We've known each other since the first day we entered high school. We became good friends because we sat together. Now we are still best friends even though we are far apart.

			<p> This is a good friend I met in college. We lived in the same dormitory building last year so we became close as soon as school started. We played games together every day during winter break. Her major is statistics. She is a very gentle and happy girl, whenever I have a sad thing will go to her to talk </p>

				Also a good friend of mine in college. She and I are studying the same major and have many classes in common, so we have kept in close contact from the first semester until now.
